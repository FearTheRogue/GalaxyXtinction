## 📌 Project Overview

**Galaxy Xtinction** is a solo-developed final year university project built in Unity over an 8-month development cycle (Sept 2021 – May 2022).

The game is a 3D space exploration and combat experience set in an alternative solar system where an alien race is deploying a deadly nerve agent to wipe out planetary life.

This project received:

- 🏆 **First Class Grade**
- 🥇 **Best Specialist Degree Posting – University Showcase Award**

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Concept

Each planet in the solar system has a **dynamic life-percentage system** displayed in the player’s HUD.

- Alien ships attack planets, reducing their life percentage in real time.
- The player must intercept enemy ships and destroy them.
- Destroyed enemies drop toxins, which can be collected and repurposed as fuel.
- Fuel enables deeper exploration into the solar system.
- Failure to defend planets results in extinction.

The gameplay loop blends:

- 🚀 Exploration  
- 🛸 Combat  
- ☣ Planetary defence  
- 🔋 Resource management

## 🏗 Core Systems Implemented

### 🚀 Physics-Based Flight & Gravity

- Rigidbody-driven spacecraft movement
- Force-based planetary gravity system
- Seamless transition between open space and planetary influence
- Physics-driven interaction rather than scripted movement

### 🛸 Enemy AI (State Machine Driven)

Custom AI system using state-based behaviour:

- Idle
- Wandering
- Pursue
- Attack

This created dynamic planetary threats and responsive combat encounters.

### 🌍 Planetary System

- Orbiting planetary bodies
- Real-time life-percentage tracking
- Event-driven updates to HUD
- Planet-wide extinction mechanic

### 🎯 Combat System

- Projectile-based shooting
- Damage handling
- Enemy defeat resource drops
- Combat feedback integrated into UI

### 🔋 Resource & Progression System

- Toxins collected from enemies
- Toxins converted into ship fuel
- Fuel determines exploration range
- Risk-reward gameplay balance

### 🧭 UI & HUD

- Real-time planetary health tracking
- Player resource display
- Combat status feedback
- Dynamic world-state visualisation

---

## 🔁 Gameplay Loop

1. Explore the solar system  
2. Identify planetary threats  
3. Engage enemy ships  
4. Collect toxin fuel  
5. Expand exploration range  
6. Prevent extinction

## 🧩 Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (C#)
- Rigidbody physics and force-based systems
- AI state machine design
- Modular gameplay system implementation
- Event-driven UI updates
- Resource-driven progression mechanics
- Long-term solo project management
- Balancing gameplay systems across a multi-month development cycle

---

## 💡 Challenges & Learning Outcomes

- Designing intuitive gravity mechanics using Rigidbody forces
- Implementing scalable enemy AI behaviour
- Structuring interconnected systems without tight coupling
- Maintaining performance across multiple active planetary systems
- Managing scope across an 8-month solo project

This project marked a turning point in my development journey, strengthening my understanding of system-driven design in Unity.
